"There is no doubt that the grail of efficiency leads to abuse. Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.
Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%. A good programmer will not be lulled into complacency by such reasoning, he will be wise to look carefully at the critical code; but only after that code has been identified."

the adventure into the unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored;
the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain;
to summarize it--the humility of the intellect. The other great heritage is Christian ethics--
the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual — the humility of the spirit.

These two heritages are logically, thoroughly consistent. But logic is not all; one needs one's heart to follow an idea.
If people are going back to religion, what are they going back to? Is the modern church a place to give comfort to a man who doubts God--
more, one who disbelieves in God? Is the modern church a place to give comfort and encouragement to the value of such doubts?
So far, have we not drawn strength and comfort to maintain the one or the other of these consistent heritages
in a way which attacks the values of the other? Is this unavoidable? How can we draw inspiration to support these
two pillars of western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor, mutually unafraid?
